# To-Do List Application

This is a simple and elegant To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks. The task list is displayed dynamically, and counters keep track of completed and uncompleted tasks.

## Features

- Add Task: Users can add new tasks to the list using the input box and the "Add" button.
- Edit Task: Users can modify existing tasks by clicking the "Edit" button next to each task.
- Delete Task: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the "Delete" button.
- Mark as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed by checking the checkbox next to them, which strikes through the task.
- Task Counters: The app dynamically tracks and displays the number of completed and uncompleted tasks.


## Technologies Used

- HTML: For the structure of the application.
- CSS: For styling the application.
- JavaScript: For handling the dynamic functionality (adding, editing, deleting tasks, and updating counters).
